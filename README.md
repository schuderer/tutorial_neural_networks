# tutorial_neural_networks
Tutorial on how to code a neural network (fully connected MLP) from scratch in Python, including the math.

It is not meant to be a particulartly efficient implementation - I tried to optimize it for understandability.

I used commends to provide the explanations which make this a tutorial.

Includes an example to apply the handcrafted neural network on the MNIST character recignition dataset. If you want to run it, you first need to obtain the data set from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.
